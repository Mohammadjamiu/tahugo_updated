      <description>POP3 and IMAP are the two protocols of message access protocols. They are used in retrieving messages from the server to the client&amp;rsquo;s end.
There are differences between POP3 and IMAP even though they are used for receiving emails only and that’s what we are going to discuss below.
What is POP3? POP3 stands for Post Office Protocol, version 3. it is a simple protocol with limited functionality which is used in retrieving emails over the mail server.</description>

      <description>In most small offices or homes, to access the internet, it can bedone through turning on our mobile hostpot so other devices canconnect to it and use the internet. But connecting more devicesmakes our signal weak, also moving the mobile phone away from otherdevices that are connected to it, makes the signal to go down. Thatswhy wired network are used at big companies, small offices andsometimes at home if one is able to afford for a mini setup.</description>

      <description>In fiber optics communication, a fiber which is a dielectric material (plastic or glass) is used as a channel or link to guide or transmit light waves over a short or long distance.
The fiber optic has a core which diameter is relatively the diameter of a hair strand.
The cladding which serves as a protective coating is also light in weight. Hence a fiber optics is still light in weight compared to coaxial cables or copper wires.</description>

      <description>In a communication system, the transmission of information from a transmitter to a receiver can be affected by various factors that degrade the quality of the signal transmitted.
These factors are known as transmission impairments.
Transmission impairment is as a result of imperfections in a transmission medium. It occurs when the signal at the receiving end is different from the signal been sent (at the transmitting end).
Understanding the causes of transmission impairments is important for designing and maintaining reliable communication systems.</description>

In order words, both packet and frames deals with a unit of data called bits.
The way I like to think of these two terms is;
Packets are streams of bits, while Frames are composed of packets.
Difference between packet and frame Packets Frames 1 A packet is composed of streams of bits packed to form a packet A frame is composed of packets of (bits) packed into frames 2 A packet resides on layer 3 which is the network layer of the OSI model A Frame resides on layer 2 which is the data link layer of the OSI model 3 The packet which can be found on the network layer is the IP packet which consist of both source and destination address The Frame which can be found on the data link layer is the Ethernet frame which consist of both source and destination MAC address </description>

      <description>Packet switching and message switching are both methods of data transmission used in computer networks.
In packet switching, when you send data over the internet, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t travel in one piece from your device to the recipient&amp;rsquo;s device. Instead, it is divided into small units called packets, each containing a piece of the data, along with information such as the recipient&amp;rsquo;s address and other necessary details.
These packets are then sent over the network through different routes or paths, and when they arrive at their destination, they are reassembled into the original message.</description>
