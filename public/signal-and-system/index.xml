      <description>What is a signal? A signal is a function of an independent variable (e.g. of space, time, or density) that carries information representing a physical phenomenon.
So anything that carries information is considered a signal e.g.
The temperature of a room, Voltage and current in an electronic circuit Digital images, video, or audio Sounds or speeches etc. Position, speed, acceleration, or velocity of an object A stock market index The flow rate of fluid etc.</description>

      <description>Before solving problems on energy and power signal, you need to understand what each of the signal means
What are power and energy signals? A power signals are signals with finite power while energy signals are signals with finite energy.
How do you solve energy and power signals? Here are the few things to remember in order to quickly identify if a signal is a power or an energy signal</description>

      <description>The following are the basic operations that can be done on discrete time signal
Addition Subtraction Multiplication Amplitude scaling Time shifting Time reversal Time scaling The first 4 operations are performed along the y or value axis while the last 3 are performed along the x or time axis.
but before solving problems on it, letâ€™s discuss briefly on what discrete-time signal mean.
what is discrete-time signals or DTS? Discrete-time signals refers to signals that are defined only at discrete or finite time.</description>

      <description>In one of our previous post we discuss about how to solve energy and power signal problems step by step with tips and shortcut and we briefly talk about what power and energy signal is. But in this post we would be discussing about the differences between power signal and energy signal.
Difference between power signal and energy signal Power signal Power signal has finite power
It has an infinite energy</description>

      <title>What are Dirichlet conditions for existence of Fourier series?</title>

      <guid>/signal-and-system/dirichlet-conditions-for-existence-of-fourier-series/</guid>
      <description>It is said that periodic signals can be analyzed using Fourier series, while non-periodic signals can be analyzed using Fourier transform.
But not all periodic signals will have a Fourier series expansion, hence here must be conditions a periodic signal have to meet for Fourier series to be used.
These conditions are defined by the mathematician Dirichlet, hence it is named Dirichlet conditions or the conditions for existence of Fourier series.</description>

      <description>A signal can be defined as any physical quantity that carries information and varies with time, space, density, and other independent variable(s). It can also be defined as a pattern of variation in a physical quantity, such as sound or light, that can be measured and analyzed.
Signals can be classified into different categories or types based on various properties, such as the direction of the signal flow or the time-domain characteristics of the signal.</description>

      <title>How to Determine if a Signal Is Even or Odd?</title>

      <guid>/signal-and-system/how-to-determine-if-a-signal-is-even-or-odd/</guid>
      <description>Knowing if a signal is an even or an odd signal is very important because it helps to simplify calculations and reduce the number of terms that need to be considered in a Fourier series or Fourier transform.
For example, when trying to find the Fourier analysis of a function, there are variables that need to be calculated, a0, an and bn where a0 is a constant value, an is the value associated with the even terms and bn is the value associated with the odd terms.</description>
