      <description>File paths are an essential part of navigating the file system while working on a Node.js project.
Understanding how to specify file paths using the /, ./, and ../ symbols is important for accessing files and directories.
When requiring a Node.js module or file, you can specify the file path using a relative or absolute path.
If the file path begins with ./ or ../, Node.js will interpret it as a relative path, and if it begins with /, Node.</description>

      <description>In Python, variables can hold various types of data, including integers (int) and floating-point numbers (float).
When dealing with dynamic data, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to ascertain whether a variable contains a numeric value before performing mathematical operations.
We will discuss two methods that help you achieve this goal: the type() function and the isinstance() function.
1. Making Use of the type() Function — Defining the Function def is_number(variable): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; This function checks if a variable is a number.</description>

      <description>Node.js has been using the &#39;require()&#39; syntax for module loading for a long time.
However, the introduction of ECMAScript (ES) modules has brought a more streamlined and standardized way of importing modules using the &amp;lsquo;import&amp;rsquo; syntax.
Steps on How to Use Import Instead of Require in Node.js To transition from &#39;require()&#39; to &#39;import&#39;, follow these steps:
Step 1: Update Your package.json The first step is to open your project&amp;rsquo;s package.json file and add the “type” field with the value “module”.</description>

      <description>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that can be used to create both client-side and server-side applications.
So, is Node.js used for backend or frontend development?
The answer is both. Node.js is a versatile platform that can be used for a variety of development tasks.
It is a popular choice for both backend and frontend development because of its event-driven, non-blocking architecture, scalability, and performance.
