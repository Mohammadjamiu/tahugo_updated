      <description>When you ask someone how can I learn the basics of circuit analysis? Most times the answer is practice-practice-practice.
Though that’s right but you can only practice stuff you find easier to understand and the necessary fundamentals to have are also right because, how can you even analyze or design a circuit if you don’t know how resistor works or you don’t love dealing with calculations.
The case here is that don’t just learn circuit analysis techniques or concepts from textbooks as if they are somewhat abstract or different, try to learn how they link with each other or what can they be used for.</description>

      <description>Solving simultaneous equations containing more than two variablescan be quite daunting if we use either elimination method orsubstitution method because, thing gets a little bit complex. Also,crammer&#39;s rule has been a technique used by engineers, students and by professors due to it compactibility and conciseness and lastly you can choose to use a calculator to help you solve that very fast.Now back to business, variable names can be x and y or a and b or Iaand Ib (as we do in circuit analysis for currents), it’s up to youto choose what you want.</description>

      <title>Why do we study circuit analysis or circuit theory?</title>
      <link>/circuit-analysis/why-do-we-study-circuit-analysis/</link>

      <guid>/circuit-analysis/why-do-we-study-circuit-analysis/</guid>
      <description>First let’s look at what circuit analysis mean.
What is circuit analysis or circuit theory? Circuit analysis or circuit theory basically deals with finding currents and voltages in a circuit or network of connected electronic components.
Why do we study circuit analysis? If you are an electronics or electrical engineering student or even a hobbyist, studying circuit analysis is essential because before you can design your own electronics gadgets or robots, you need to learn the fundamentals behind circuits.</description>

      <description>As an electrical engineering student, we all have that one course that frightens us and one of them is electromagnetic field theory, sometimes called engineering electromagnetic.
In this section, I would discuss why it is difficult to learn and understand electromagnetic field theory and then proceed to how we can grasp the concepts using some techniques and tips.
Why is electromagnetic field theory difficult to learn? It is difficult to learn because, it is full of abstractions (meaning concepts that cannot be seen physically with the naked eye except by imagination, experience or by accident) for example an electric field, a magnetic field, or electricity.</description>

      <guid>/funmaths/how-to-solve-equation-using-calculator/</guid>
      <description>In this post, we would solve a simultaneous equation in a very fastand short time step by step using a Casio fx – 991MS as thecalculator to help us achieve our goal.For example, let’s say our equation is [6x + 2y = 10] and [4x + y =4] and we are to solve for the variables x and y.Step 1 -Switch on the calculator and then reset it, this is due to the factthat sometimes we might have done some operation before which canthen alter our result for instance, if we put our calculator inradian, the value is different from if it is in degree so thereforealways reset your calculator when starting off a new calculation.</description>

      <guid>/circuit-analysis/kirchhoffs-current-and-voltage-law-explained/</guid>
      <description>Before diving into what the Kirchhoff’s law is, can you solve this circuit using ohm&amp;rsquo;s law to find all the currents flowing in each branch of the circuit.
I probably know it will be frustrating to solve this circuit using ohm&amp;rsquo;s law because there are more than one connection of resistors and also more than one loop which means ohm&amp;rsquo;s law won’t be a perfect technique to use
Rather, we need an optimized technique which still is based on ohm&amp;rsquo;s law (as ohm&amp;rsquo;s law is the base that relates voltage, current and resistance) but it is a little bit easier to work with.</description>

      <description>Thevenin theorem is a theorem used to model complex circuits into a simple circuit with an equivalent voltage source and resistance.
As the theorem states that;
‘any two terminals of a network can be replaced by an equivalent voltage source and an equivalent series resistance.
The voltage source is the voltage across the two terminals with load, if any, removed.
The series resistance is the resistance of the network measured between two terminals with load removed and constant voltage source being replaced by its internal resistance (or if it is not given with zero resistance, i.</description>

      <description>The way solar cells work to generate electricity is by absorbing energy from the sun (which constitutes tiny particles called photons).
This energy from the sun strikes the solar cells thereby resulting in electrons being knocked out from their normal position and then being allowed to move freely, resulting to be the current that flows through our circuits or light bulb at home.
But there is more physics behind how solar cells work to generate electricity so let’s look into that.</description>

      <description>In most small offices or homes, to access the internet, it can bedone through turning on our mobile hostpot so other devices canconnect to it and use the internet. But connecting more devicesmakes our signal weak, also moving the mobile phone away from otherdevices that are connected to it, makes the signal to go down. Thatswhy wired network are used at big companies, small offices andsometimes at home if one is able to afford for a mini setup.</description>

      <description>Without modulation, it might seem impossible for human to communicate over a long distance. Because when we speak, it get propagated into space and dies out and the information can only be gotten if the person we want to communicate with is close.
Know that the frequency of human voice is around the range of 20hz to 20Khz which is low and can&amp;rsquo;t travel far. With this in mind, a third party is needed to carry the information over a long distance just as if you throw a piece of paper on the ground, it takes longer to go down because air makes it to float but if you tie a stone to the paper, it goes down quickly.</description>

      <description>Every website can be accessed through an IP address but memorizing this addresses (written in such form 196.168.45.5) can be difficult rather, a name is given to a user in order to access the internet. The conversion or resolving of the domain name you are given to the actual IP address is a task carried out by DNS.
What is DNS? DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a system which is used to resolve or convert a domain name to IP address.</description>

      <guid>/digital-electronics/advantages-of-flip-flop-over-latch/</guid>
      <description>The use of flip-flops in digital electronics has several advantages over latches. Here are some of the advantages:
Advantages of Flip-flops over Latches Clock Input: Flip-flops have a clock input that allows them to change state only when a clock signal is present. This makes flip-flops useful in synchronous circuits, where all events must occur synchronously.
Stability: Flip-flops are always stable, while latches can be unstable. The stability of flip-flops makes them useful in systems where the state of the system must be maintained even when the input is not stable.</description>

      <description>Latches and flip-flops are both types of circuits used in digital electronics to store binary information. But with this similarity, there are some key differences between them.
What is a Latch? A latch is a circuit that has two stable states and can store one bit of information. It is a level-sensitive device, which means that its output depends on the level of the inputs.
Latches are often used to store the state of a system and are used in many applications, such as data storage, memory, and sequential logic.</description>

      <guid>/electronics/what-are-the-advantages-of-digital-modulation-over-analog-modulation/</guid>
      <description>Modulation is the process of modifying a carrier wave to encode information for transmission. The carrier wave is a high-frequency signal that is used to carry the information signal from the transmitter to the receiver.
Without modulation, the information, or message signal would not be able to travel over long distances, as the message signal is often a low frequency signal.
What Is an Analog Modulation? Analog modulation involves varying the amplitude, frequency, or phase of the carrier wave to encode the information signal.</description>

      <guid>/signal-and-system/how-to-find-the-convolution-sum-of-discrete-time-signals/</guid>
      <description>Convolution of two discrete time signal can be achieved using the convolution sum.
Convolution sum is a mathematical tool that is used for combining two discrete signals to form a new (or third) signal.
It is defined as:
$ Y(n) = x*{1}(n) \circledast x*{2}(n) $ which can be calculated using
$ Y(n) = \sum*{k=0} x*{1}(k)x_{2}(n-k) $
In essence one of the signal maybe $ x_{1}(n)$ is kept the way it is while the other is shifted and the sum of their products results in the convolution sum of two signals.</description>
