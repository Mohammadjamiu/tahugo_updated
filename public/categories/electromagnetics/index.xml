      <description>In this post, I would be listing out the resources to help you self-learn electromagnetics fieldtheory from scratch and these resources are what I’ve came across over the years as an electricalengineering student trying to desperately learn electromagnetics field theory because, to be frankwith you it’s a difficult but interesting course.Note
I will advise you not to limit your learning journey to these resources only but, try to exploremore and we would love to hear any recommendation from you on any stuff you have found usefulother than the ones listed here so we can help other engineers too.</description>

      <description>As human, we have once even by accident, played or saw a magnet and the only basic thing we know about it is that it attracts metal which is true but still, there are more to magnets and what we can do with it.
So in this post we would be discussing few important facts that you need to know about a magnet.
What is a magnet? Basically, a magnet is defined as a piece of material that has the ability to attract itself to other conductive materials like metals (iron, cobalt, e.</description>

      <description>As an electrical engineering student, we all have that one course that frightens us and one of them is electromagnetics field theory sometimes called engineering electromagnetics.
In this section, I would discuss why it is difficult to learn and understand electromagnetics field theory and then proceed to how we can grasp the concepts using some techniques and tips.
Why is electromagnetics field theory difficult to learn? It is difficult to learn because, it is full of abstractions (meaning concepts that can’t be seen physically with the naked eye except by imagination, experience or by accident) for example an electric field, a magnetic field, or electricity.</description>
