      <description>Basically diode is an electronic device or component that every circuits that we might think of has, be it the circuit inside a radio, a lamp, or your smartphone etc.
So knowing what it is or what it is used for and the different types of diode is vital for an electronics hobbyist, or even electrical engineering students trying to design their own circuit.
What is a diode? A diode is an electronic component that has two terminals positive (+ve) and negative (-ve) (also referred to as PN junction diode) which allows current to flow only in one direction.</description>

      <guid>/electronics/how-do-solar-cells-work-to-generate-electricity/</guid>
      <description>The way solar cells work to generate electricity is by absorbing energy from the sun (which constitutes tiny particles called photons).
This energy from the sun strikes the solar cells thereby resulting in electrons being knocked out from their normal position and then being allowed to move freely, resulting to be the current that flows through our circuits or light bulb at home.
But there is more physics behind how solar cells work to generate electricity so letâ€™s look into that.</description>

      <description>Programming is important to electrical and electronics engineering (or EEE for short) because EEE is all about problem-solving and these problems are solved using mathematics, physics, and programming (sometimes referred to as coding).
But what is programming all about? Programming is a skill or tool that is used for commanding or instructing computers or hardware devices to do a specific task most especially those that are repetitive and need precision because a human can&amp;rsquo;t, or those tasks that help to make life easier for us.</description>

      <description>Before going in depth of what a resistor is used for and the other things you need to know about it, you need to know what it is.
What is a resistor? A resistor is an electronics component that limits (or reduce) the flow of current in a circuit, as well as cause voltage to be dropped across it.
In other words, it main purpose or function in a circuit is to control current flow.</description>

      <guid>/electronics/what-is-modulation-in-communication-its-types-and-why-we-modulate/</guid>
      <description>Without modulation, it might seem impossible for human to communicate over a long distance. Because when we speak, it get propagated into space and dies out and the information can only be gotten if the person we want to communicate with is close.
Know that the frequency of human voice is around the range of 20hz to 20Khz which is low and can&amp;rsquo;t travel far. With this in mind, a third party is needed to carry the information over a long distance just as if you throw a piece of paper on the ground, it takes longer to go down because air makes it to float but if you tie a stone to the paper, it goes down quickly.</description>

      <description>The major reason why we can communicate wirelessly is through the adventure of radio waves.
What are radio waves? Radio waves are part of the electromagnetic spectrum family with frequencies in the range of 3Khz to 300Ghz which consist of radio frequency RF waves and microwaves.
It can also be defined as an electromagnetic wave with an electric field (E) and magnetic field (H) components.
Know:
Radio waves are called wireless wave because the word &amp;ldquo;radio&amp;rdquo; is used to signify &amp;ldquo;wireless communication&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used by engineers to measure power, voltage/current or sound level.
It is mostly used when there is loss or gain in power (or signal strength), pressure, voltage or sound level.
In essence the dB is a measure of the ratio between two parameters. The parameter can be a signal strength from one point to another in a transmission line, pressure between two points, voltage between two points etc.</description>

      <description>Baseband and broadband transmission are ways in which digital signals can be transmitted from one point to another.
Baseband transmission Baseband transmission refers to transmission in which a digital signal is sent over a channel without changing or converting the digital signal to an analog signal.
Broadband transmission Broadband transmission sometimes referred to as modulation means changing or converting a digital signal to analog signal for transmission.
Note
The conversion from digital to analog is possible with modulation.</description>

      <guid>/electronics/what-is-electricity-and-how-does-it-work/</guid>
      <description>Electricity is basically what flows through a wire or a conductor and then power up our light bulb, TV, and other electronic gadgets at home. And it works by letting tiny particles called electrons to flow or move through a conductive closed path.
In essence, a wire which is a conductor allows those electrons to flow through it resulting in what is called electric current or electricity.
But to understand what electricity is and how it works on a deeper level, we need to zoom down to zero and understand the physics behind it.</description>

      <guid>/electronics/frequency-modulation-formula-with-solved-examples/</guid>
      <description>Definition of Frequency modulation (FM) Frequency modulation (FM) is a type of angle modulation in which the frequency of the carrier wave (mostly sine wave) is varied in accordance to the frequency of the modulating or message signal while keeping amplitude and phase constant.
Derivation of frequency modulation (FM) formula In general, angle modulated signal $S(t)$ is represented as $S(t) = A_{c}cos[\theta_{i}(t)]$ and the instantaneous frequency (i.e. the frequency at each instance) is defined as $f_{i}(t) = f_{c} + k_{f}m(t)$.</description>

      <description>In communication, baseband signal is the original or natural information (i.e. the information we are interested to send) e.g. voice, image, or video. Baseband is also called the message signal.
But to carry this baseband signal over a long distance as it has a low frequency, modulation needs to take place. If the baseband or original message is used to modify a carrier wave (i.e. modulation process) then after modulation, the information that is transferred is the passband signal.</description>

      <description>Horn antenna is an antenna which is constructed by flaring (or opening) of a waveguide (a metallic material) in order to direct electromagnetic waves in one direction.
What is a horn antenna used for? It is a directional antenna which is used to increase directivity It helps in improving impedance matching because the waveguide mostly has impedance of about 50Î© while the impedance of the free space is 377Î©. In order to match out the impedance so as to reduce power loss, a flaring is used to kind of concentrate the electromagnetic waves.</description>

Basic elements of communication systems In a communication system, there are generally five basic elements, which are:
Information (or data, is the actual message such as human voice) Transmitter (a device used for transmitting the information received) Communication Channel (or medium, is the medium where the message can travel through) Noise (or random signal which is introduced while transmitting the information, can be caused due to several natural factors such as thunder, sun radiation etc.</description>

      <guid>/electronics/what-are-the-advantages-of-digital-modulation-over-analog-modulation/</guid>
      <description>Modulation is the process of modifying a carrier wave to encode information for transmission. The carrier wave is a high-frequency signal that is used to carry the information signal from the transmitter to the receiver.
Without modulation, the information, or message signal would not be able to travel over long distances, as the message signal is often a low frequency signal.
What Is an Analog Modulation? Analog modulation involves varying the amplitude, frequency, or phase of the carrier wave to encode the information signal.</description>
