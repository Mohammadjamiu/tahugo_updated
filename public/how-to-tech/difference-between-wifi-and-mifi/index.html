MiFi devices are typically plug-and-play, requiring a SIM card and activation from a cellular service provider. Once activated, the MiFi device creates a Wi-Fi hotspot that other devices can connect to.</li>
<li><strong>Is MiFi the same as Wi-Fi?</strong> No, MiFi and Wi-Fi are not the same. Wi-Fi refers to a wireless technology that allows devices to connect to a local network or the internet without the need for physical cables. It typically involves a fixed router or access point that provides wireless connectivity within a specific area. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, MiFi, short for Mobile Wi-Fi, is a portable device that acts as a personal hotspot, creating a Wi-Fi network using cellular data connectivity. MiFi devices allow users to connect multiple devices to the internet on the go, utilizing cellular networks for connectivity.</li>
