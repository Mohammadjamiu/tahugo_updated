## **Key Terminologies**

Here are some key terms that need to be understood or referenced in order to understand what you are about to read on **what is ChatGPT?,** **where does it get its data from? And its capabilities.**

> ### **\# What is an AI?**
>
> **AI** is a short form for **Artificial Intelligence**, and it refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.
>
> AI technologies enable machines to perform tasks that usually require human-like intelligence, such as speech recognition, decision-making, language translation, and problem-solving.
>
> **AI systems,** can be designed to perform specific tasks or to simulate human cognition more generally.
>
> They are also designed to learn and improve over time, using algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make predictions based on that data.
>
> Some AI systems can also adapt to new situations and make decisions based on their past experiences.
>
> ### **\# What is NLP?**
>
> **NLP** stands for **Natural Language Processing**, and it is a technology that helps computers understand and use human language.
>
> It helps computers perform tasks such as recognizing speech, translating languages, analyzing sentiment, and answering questions.
>
> NLP algorithms use various techniques to process and analyze text data.
>
> ### **\# What is Machine Learning?**
>
> **Machine learning** is a subfield or part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
>
> Machine learning algorithms learn patterns in the data through the process of training and use these patterns to make predictions on new, unseen data.
>
> There are different types of machine learning techniques such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

## What is ChatGPT?

**ChatGPT** is a conversational AI chatbot that allows you to enter a prompt and based on that prompt, it will generate a text based output.

> **A prompt** is a question or set of instructions used to initiate or guide a task or conversation.

It is based on the [GPT architecture](/how-to-tech/what-version-of-gpt-is-chat-gpt-using/) developed by OpenAI and was released to the public in November 2022.

> GPT stands for **“Generative Pre-trained Transformer”**, which is a type of neural network architecture used for natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, language translation, and question answering.

It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate human-like responses to user inputs.

ChatGPT has been trained on a large corpus of text data, allowing it to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to user inputs.

It is capable of understanding and responding to a wide range of topics and can be customized to suit the needs of different users and businesses.

## The GPT Architecture?

There have been several versions of the GPT architecture, each with an increase in capacity and performance. The first version, **GPT-1**, was released by OpenAI in 2018, and had 117 million parameters.

**GPT-1** achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous natural language processing benchmarks at the time, such as language modeling and text completion tasks.

The second version, **GPT-2**, was released in 2019, and was much larger than its predecessor (GPT-1), with 1.5 billion parameters. \
\
GPT-2 achieved impressive results on a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including generating realistic text, summarizing documents, and answering questions.

Other versions of the GPT architecture is GPT-3, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (the newest OpenAI model).

**GPT-3** has a staggering 175 billion parameters, while **GPT-3.5** and **GPT-4** has over 175 billion parameters.

**GPT-4** is estimated to be trained with over 1 trillion parameters.

## What GPT architecture is ChatGPT is based on?

**ChatGPT** is based on the **GPT-3.5 architecture**, and has been fine-tuned on a large corpus of conversational data, making it particularly adept or good at generating human-like responses to a wide range of prompts and questions.

## Where does ChatGPT get its data from?

**ChatGPT, is trained on a large dataset of text data which comes from several sources, such as books, articles, Wikipedia and scientific journals, code repositories and social media posts.**

The text data is carefully curated to ensure that it represents a diverse range of topics and styles of writing.

> ***A word of warning!***
>
> ChatGPT is not connected to the internet, and sometimes can produce incorrect answers or texts.

Currently, ChatGPT is trained not only on top of GPT-3.5 architecture, but also on GPT-4 LLM.

> **LLM** stands for “large language model”

GPT-3.5 can only generate texts, but GPT-4 LLM can generate or accepts both texts and images.

This newer version of ChatGPT called GPT-4 which is based on GPT-4 LLM is available to limited paid subscribers only.

## ChatGPT Capabilities and Updates:

ChatGPT has been constantly upgraded and improved with enhanced capabilities since December 2022. Some of the key updates include:

* In December 2022, the ability to view past conversations and rename saved conversations was added.
* In early January 2023, the ability to stop ChatGPT from generating responses was added, and factuality was improved across a wide range of topics.
* In late January 2023, mathematical capabilities were added.
* In early February 2023, OpenAI announced an experimental feature that allows users to select different versions of ChatGPT – the standard ChatGPT model (default version) and the optimized version (called turbo).
* On March 14, 2023, GPT-4, the sequel to GPT-3/3.5, was announced. GPT-4 has enhanced capabilities such as advanced reasoning, the ability to work with complex instructions, and more creativity.
* In late March 2023, OpenAI rolled out experimental support for AI plugins that can be used with ChatGPT. One of the plugins rolled out is the browsing plugin, which is an experimental model that knows when and how to surf or browse the web. Another is the code interpreter plugin that allows ChatGPT to use Python, and to handle uploads and downloads. The last is the third-party plugins.
* In May 2023, the ability for users to turn off chat history and to export their data from the ChatGPT settings was added. Beta features of several plugins have also been released.
