**ChatGPT** is a chatbot created by OpenAI. It was initially released as a prototype on November 30, 2022. It quickly gained traction due to its ability to provide detailed and knowledgeable responses across various subjects.

**ChatGPT uses the GPT-3.5 model to have interactive conversations with humans. It has also been updated to use the latest GPT model – GPT-4.**

**GPT-4** is multimodal, i.e., it has the ability to not work with only text and code as in the case of GPT-3.5 but also works with images.

**Read on:** *[Difference between GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3/3.5 and GPT-4](/how-to-tech/difference-between-gpt-1-gpt-2-gpt-3-gpt-4/)*

It is designed to respond to user inputs in a conversational manner, making it feel like you're talking to a real person. 

The free version of ChatGPT utilizes 20 billion parameters from the GPT-3.5 model to generate convincing and coherent text-based responses.

GPT-3.5, like other [GPT models](/how-to-tech/difference-between-gpt-1-gpt-2-gpt-3-gpt-4/), is trained on a vast amount of data from the internet, which helps it learn patterns, grammar, and context. This extensive training allows ChatGPT to generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

GPT-3.5 excels at understanding and generating text based on context. It can take into account the previous parts of a conversation to provide coherent and relevant responses. 

This contextual understanding contributes to more natural and meaningful interactions with the chatbot.

While ChatGPT strives to provide helpful and accurate responses, it may occasionally produce incorrect or nonsensical answers. It is important to remember that it is an AI model and may not always grasp the nuances or complexities of certain topics. 

Users should exercise critical thinking and verify information from reliable sources when needed.

OpenAI has implemented content filters to minimize inappropriate or harmful outputs from ChatGPT. However, these filters may not catch every potential issue, and OpenAI actively encourages user feedback to improve the system's safety measures.

OpenAI is committed to ongoing research and development to improve the capabilities and safety of models like GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT. User feedback and real-world usage help identify areas for enhancement and refinement.

As with any AI technology, it is important to use ChatGPT responsibly and ethically. OpenAI provides usage guidelines and encourages users to be mindful of potential biases, misinformation, or harmful actions that could arise from misusing AI-generated content.

OpenAI has also made available the ChatGPT and Whisper model APIs for software developers. 

These APIs allow developers to integrate AI-powered language processing and speech-to-text capabilities into their own applications. 

The ChatGPT API utilizes the same GPT-3.5-turbo AI model as the chatbot itself. Developers can either use the original version of ChatGPT or customize it to suit their specific needs.

The pricing for the ChatGPT API is $0.002 per 1000 tokens, which is roughly equivalent to 750 words. This pricing makes it significantly more cost-effective compared to using the GPT-3.5 models directly.

Currently, ChatGPT have access to **GPT-4** which is the latest version of the GPT model, released in the 2023. It is a highly advanced language model with an estimated 100 trillion parameters, making it even more powerful than its predecessor, GPT-3 and GPT-3.5.
