The programming languages ​​taught in universities can vary depending on the institution, department and  course. However,  the most common programming languages ​​taught at the university are: 
 Java: Java is a popular programming language that is widely used to develop mobile applications, desktop applications and web applications. It is known for its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy, which means that code written in Java can run without modification on any platform that supports Java. 
 C : C is a powerful high-performance programming language  widely used in systems programming, game development, and scientific computing. It is an extension of the C programming language and provides object-oriented programming features. 
 Python: Python is a high-level programming language  widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence and web development. It has a simple and easy-to-learn syntax, making it an excellent choice for beginners. 
 C: C is a low-level programming language  widely used in systems programming, embedded systems, and game development. It is known for its low memory footprint and fast load times. 
 SQL: SQL is a domain specific language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is widely used in information management, data analysis and big data. 
 R: R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used in data analysis, statistical modeling and data visualization. 
 MATLAB: MATLAB is a programming language and environment for numerical computing, visualization and programming. It is widely used in scientific computing, engineering and data analysis. 
 LISP: Lisp is a family of programming languages ​​known for their powerful symbolic computing capabilities and  widely used in artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. 
 These are just a few examples of  programming languages ​​taught in universities. The programming languages ​​taught depend on the specific program and course. Some universities also offer courses that focus on specific programming languages ​​or frameworks, such as web development or mobile application development.
