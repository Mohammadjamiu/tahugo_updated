**ChatGPT** is an AI language model that has taken the internet by storm. It is capable of generating responses to your input text that can be remarkably coherent and contextually appropriate – most times. 

But at times it may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.

**Read on:** *[Is Google Bard Better Than ChatGPT?](/how-to-tech/is-google-bard-better-than-chatgpt/)*

We discuss in one of our articles *[where does ChatGPT get its data from?](/how-to-tech/where-does-chatgpt-get-data-from/)* And it is noted that ChatGPT is trained on a massive dataset of text and code that is stored on the internet.

This dataset includes everything from books and articles to code repositories and social media posts.

When you ask ChatGPT a question, it uses this dataset to find the information it needs to generate a response.

**But does it actually have access to the internet?** Because when you ask ChatGPT, a prompt like *who currently own twitter?* Which is a prompt that has to do with latest event, you get a response like this from ChatGPT:

> **ChatGPT's Response:**
>
> *As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, Twitter is a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “TWTR”. Therefore, it is owned by its shareholders, who can buy and sell shares on the stock market. The largest shareholders at that time were investment firms and funds, including The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley. Jack Dorsey was the CEO of Twitter at the time, but he has since stepped down and been replaced by Parag Agrawal.*

This shows that it's knowledge is limited to event from 2021 backward.

To proceed with our discussion, let's ask ChatGPT the question “Does ChatGPT use the internet?” and see what it gives us.

> **ChatGPT's Response:**

> *As an AI language model, I don't have direct access to the internet. I'm a software program running on servers owned and maintained by OpenAI. When you interact with me, your messages are transmitted to OpenAI's servers, where they're processed by my algorithms and a response is generated. This response is then transmitted back to you via the internet. So, while I don't have direct access to the internet, my operation does rely on it to function.*

Which is actually true. Because by default, **ChatGPT does not have direct access to the internet. But can be given the power to access the internet.**

For example, you can use the **WebChatGPT** Chrome and Firefox extension, which allows ChatGPT to search or surf the web for information. It adds relevant web results to your ChatGPT prompts for a more accurate and up-to-date conversations.

* [WebChatGPT Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webchatgpt-chatgpt-with-i/lpfemeioodjbpieminkklglpmhlngfcn)

In addition to that, OpenAI is working on plugins that will allow ChatGPT to access and process information from the web or internet.

One of the ChatGPT's plugins – **WolframAlpha** can give response on complex mathematics problem which is up-to-date as you can see in the twitter snippet below.

***Here are some updates about ChatGPT you may wish to know:***

ChatGPT has undergone a series of upgrades and improvements since December 2022. 

The updates include the addition of features such as viewing past conversations and renaming saved conversations. 

In January 2023, the ability to stop ChatGPT from generating responses was introduced, along with improved factuality across various topics. Mathematical capabilities were added in late January 2023. 

In February 2023, OpenAI offered users the option to select different versions of ChatGPT, including the standard model and an optimized version called “turbo.”

On March 14, 2023, OpenAI announced GPT-4, which has advanced reasoning, the ability to handle complex instructions, and increased creativity. In late March 2023, experimental support for AI plugins was introduced, including browsing, code interpreter, and third-party plugins. 

In May 2023, additional features were added, allowing users to turn off chat history and export their data, along with the release of beta features for several plugins.
