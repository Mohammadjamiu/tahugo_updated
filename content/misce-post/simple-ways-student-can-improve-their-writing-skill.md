Being a student that loves to write and help others learn abstractive stuffs, I have been struggling a lot to improve my writing skill because it pays off a lot while in school and even out of school.

So in this post I will be sharing some of the most important ways (in no specific order) that can really help student improve their writing skill and in essence, become a better writer.

## Share what you know by writing and don’t aim for perfect but good

The starting point to any writing will likely be based on what you already know or love.

So sharing it with people by just writing it on paper or even for yourself is a way of giving yourself that freedom of thought and becoming good at it.

<p class="little-nugget">Note</p>
<p class="quote-text">
Never aim to be perfect but good because aiming for perfect is a way of procrastinating and limiting yourself because most of the great works in the world is not something that is done in one day, it takes time.</p>
</blockquote>

## Read extensively and also be a lover of knowledge

It is a legacy to know what you know and especially if it have impacts on people.

So, expanding your knowledge by reading through different but good and interesting books or publications is actually a way of building your brain’s muscle to be able to hold unto even difficult writings.

**Here’s how you can expand your knowledge**
<br>

1. Read newspaper or journals that you love or is related to your field.
2. Search for writing competition or challenges in your local community or online and participate.

## Make dictionary your friend

Making dictionary your friend is an excellent way of improving your writings, knowing new words and even what they mean. But I didn’t say you have to be moving around with the big oxford dictionary.

As a student you can install some pretty good and useful dictionary apps on your mobile phone as we all know that the world is digitalized.

## Become an author

Write your experiences or thoughts and share it with the world and those that really find value in what you do will definitely appreciate your hard work and it is even a way of making a living because you can get cash out of it.

Your experiences might just be what you find hard learning and you simplify things out and make an eBook off of it.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="little-nugget">Note</p>
<p class="quote-text">
Note not to share your secrets with the world and assume you are improving your writing skill or impacting the world.</p>
</blockquote>

## When a thought comes to mind, don’t procrastinate – just write

Most times you can be in a hyped state that ideas are just flowing and the game is rolling smoothly, don’t let this time pass you by, by you letting it go.

So just write things down because the truth is that the good works you will end up doing might not be something you decided do right away but a series of little things that are merged together to form something great.

## Use simple but good writing apps or tools

When writing or just starting out on writing, don’t indulge yourself on tools or apps that might not really impact your writing craft.

So starting with the basic tools which is a paper and pen is pretty much good enough.

But as time passes by, you might invest in using some simple apps like

1. Microsoft word or notepad to type and
2. <a class="links-to-others" href="https://www.grammarly.com" target="_blank">Grammarly </a> to check for errors in your writing.

## Learn to type fast

Learning to type fast is a super power that can really impact your writing journey and can be fun sometimes.

Here are some resources to help you learn how to type fast

1. learn how to touch type using <a class="links-to-others" href="https://ratatype.com/learn" target="_blank">ratatye</a> simple guide.
2. <a class="links-to-others" href="https://10fastfingers.com" target="_blank">10fastfingers </a>- to help you practice.

## Chase simple words

While writing, you might be tempted to use really big grammars to impress people but the reality is **no one cares**, just go with simple words that can really have value on people that are not educated as you are and those that are educated than you’re because the goal is to impact as much as you can.

This is one of the most important thing that is recommended when students are <a class="links-to-article" href="/misce-post/simple-essay-writing-tips-for-student/">writing an essay</a>.

## Don’t edit or make corrections while writing

The reason not to edit while writing is because, whilst you are writing and at the same time editing, there might be some important things that you might miss to write down.

So the best thing to do is write first and when you’re done pouring all the stuffs out, filter through them and do your editing.

## Try to organize things

I’m guilty of this because sometimes I would write some important information down but later on, I won’t know exactly where it is or where I wrote it on.

But there is one thing to do and it is to use apps which at least can help you digitalize your writings and organize them.

## listen to podcast of your choice

This also quite relates to what we have been discussing earlier but instead of you reading books or publications, you listen to them and here are few benefit you can get out of it.

1. You learn more and also learn new words.
2. You learn to speak better and get transformed.

You can navigate through YouTube or Google and search for podcast of your choice.

Here are some ways you can improve your writing skill though, there are more but still we hope you benefit from this.
