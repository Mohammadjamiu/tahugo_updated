In one of our previous post we discuss about how to solve <a href="/signal-and-system/how-do-you-solve-energy-and-power-signals-problem/">energy and power signal problems</a> step by step with tips and shortcut and we briefly talk about what power and energy signal is. But in this post we would be discussing about the differences between power signal and energy signal.

## Difference between power signal and energy signal

### Power signal

1. Power signal has finite power

2. It has an infinite energy
3. If the amplitude of a signal is constant as the function tends to infinity at time (t) the, that signal is a power signal
4. Periodic signals are power signals
5. sinusoidal function is an example of a power signal

### Energy signal

1. Energy signal has finite energy

2. It has a zero power
3. If the amplitude of a signal is zero as the function tends to infinity at time (t) the, that signal is an energy signal
4. Non-periodic signals are energy signals
5. Exponential (decaying or increasing) function is an example of an energy signal
6. If a discrete time signal has a sequence that converges then that discrete signal is an energy signal but if it diverges, it is not an energy signal
