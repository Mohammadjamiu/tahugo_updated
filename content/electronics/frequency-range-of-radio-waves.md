The frequency range of radio waves are specified in the table below with the EM spectrum (band) and their respective application.

| s/n | frequency range | EM spectrum (Band)      | Application                                   |
| :-- | :-------------- | :---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1.  | 30Hz - 300Hz    | ELF                     | Power line communications                     |
| 2.  | 300Hz - 3KHz    | Voice/ speech Frequency | Speech, voice communication                   |
| 3.  | 3KHz - 30KHz    | VLF                     | Long-range radio navigation                   |
| 4.  | 30KHz - 300KHz  | LF                      | navigational locator, submarine communication |
| 5.  | 300KHz - 3MHz   | MF                      | AM Radio                                      |
| 6.  | 3Mhz - 30MHz    | HF                      | Ship/Aircraft                                 |
| 7.  | 30Mhz - 300MHz  | VHF                     | FM broadcasting                               |
| 8.  | 300Mhz - 3GHz   | UHF                     | cellular, TV communication                    |
| 9.  | 3Ghz - 30GHz    | SHF                     | Microwave communication                       |
| 10. | 30Ghz - 300GHz  | EHF                     | Radar, satellite communication                |
