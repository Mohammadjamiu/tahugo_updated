## Simplex mode of communication

In simplex mode, the direction at which devices communicate is unidirectional, i.e. one can only send while the other can receive and not the other way round.

Examples of device that use simplex mode;

1. Keyboard
2. Monitor
3. Speaker

For example, a keyboard can only send to a monitor, and a monitor can only display the information on its screen.

## Half duplex mode of communication

In half-duplex, each device can both transmit and receive information or communicate with other devices, but not at the same time. Just as in walkie-talkie where if one is sending you an information, you cannot listen or reply unless he/she releases the button.

Another example is if computer A is sending to computer B, computer B has to wait until computer A is done sending before it can send.

In half-duplex, since communication is one way there is high rate of collision which can be controlled by using CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection).

Examples of device that use half duplex mode is Walkie-talkie.

## Full duplex mode of communication

In full-duplex, which can be called duplex for short, devices can both transmit and receive information or communicate with one another simultaneously.

Examples of device that use full-duplex mode is the
telephone network.

In half-duplex, since communication is one way there is high rate of collision which can be controlled by using CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)

## Full duplex mode of communication

In full-duplex, which can be called duplex for short, devices can both transmit and receive information or communicate with one another simultaneously. Just as in the telephone network.

As opposed to half-duplex, full-duplex is a two-way communication that does not need CSMA/CD.

## Summary

Simplex communication takes place in only one direction while half-duplex communication takes place in one direction at a time and lastly full-duplex communication takes place in both directions.

In today's modern world, simplex and full-duplex mode of communication is still used but for half-duplex, it is no longer used.
