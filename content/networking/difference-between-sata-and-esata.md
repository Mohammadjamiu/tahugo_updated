Both **SATA and eSATA** are connectors which are used for connecting storage devices. SATA is used to connect internal storage devices while eSATA is used to connect external devices.

## Difference between SATA and eSATA

|     | SATA                                                                                                                                                                                      | eSATA                                                                                                                    |

| 1   | **SATA** stand for Serial Advanced Technology Attachment                                                                                                                                  | **eSATA** stands for external Serial Advanced Technology Attachment                                                      |
| 2   | **SATA** is a connector which is used to connect internal storage devices                                                                                                                 | **eSATA** is a connector which is used to connect external storage devices                                               |
| 3   | **SATA** has a cable length of 1m or 3.3ft                                                                                                                                                | **eSATA** has a cable length of 2m or 6.6ft                                                                              |
| 4   | **SATA** is commonly used for data storage                                                                                                                                                | **eSATA** is commonly used for audio processing and video processing                                                     |
| 5   | **SATA** has several versions such as SATA I, SATA II, SATA III and SATAe (SATA express) and they support speed in the range of 1.5Gbits/s, 3Gbits/s, 6Gbits/s and 16Gbits/s respectively | **eSATA** does not have several versions                                                                                 |
| 6   | **SATA** cables is less thicker tha eSATA's cable                                                                                                                                         | **eSATA** cables is more thicker tha eATA's cable so as to prevent interference as the length is increased from 1m to 2m |
