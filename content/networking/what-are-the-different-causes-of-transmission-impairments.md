**Transmission impairment** is as a result of imperfections in a transmission medium. It occurs when the signal at the receiving end is different from the signal been sent (at the transmitting end).

## Causes of transmission impairments

There are three types of transmission impairments which you can recall as **DAN**. As in “DAN is the cause of transmission impairment”. Where D is distortion or dispersion, A is attenuation and N is noise, so let discuss each below;

1. **Distortion**

   Distortion means a deformation in the shape of a signal.
   It can occur due to different signals mixing up and the rate at which they travel are different which leads to different phase (hence different waveforms).

   In optics fiber communication, distortion can be termed to be <a class="links-to-article" href="/networking/what-is-dispersion-in-optical-fiber-and-the-types/">dispersion</a> loss.

2. **Attenuation**

   Attenuation means the degrading, cutting-off or loss of energy or the strength of a signal.

   The attenuation is mostly as a result of the resistance in the transmission medium which needs to be compensated for signal to be able to travel through and this is why electric current (electric signal) carrying conductor gets hot after some period of time.

   However, as the signal is attenuated, it can be compensated with the use of an amplifiers which helps to amplify the attenuated signal.

   Attenuation in mathematics or engineering sense is expressed in decibels (dB). i.e. 0dB means no loss but -3dB refers to an attenuation equal to half of the transmitted power. More on <a class="links-to-article" href="/electronics/decibel-explained-simply">dB explanation </a>.

3. **Noise**

   Noise which is the most impairment that a transmission medium is susceptible to apart from attenuation. Several types of noise are thermal noise, induced noise, crosstalk and impulse noise.

   **Thermal noise** is caused by random movement of electrons in a wire carrying signal which leads to heat (a new signal) that affects the original signal.

   **Induced noise** is cause by electric motor or appliances.

   **Crosstalk** is the effect of one wire on the other as there are many wires or conductors used in transmission of signals.

   **Impulse noise** is a spike (a signal with high energy for a very short time) which can be caused due to lightening or surge currents.
