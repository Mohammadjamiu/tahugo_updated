description: Dispersion refers to the broadening or spreading of transmitted
  light pulses as they travel along the fiber. The two types of dispersion loss
  are intramodal (chromatic dispersion) and intermodal (modal dispersion).

In fiber optics communication, there are several [transmission impairments](/networking/what-are-the-different-causes-of-transmission-impairments/) which degrades signal strength as light pulses travel along a fiber. Among the transmission impairment, is dispersion and it is discussed below.

## what is dispersion?

**Dispersion** refers to the broadening or spreading of transmitted light pulses as they travel along the fiber. As each light pulse broadens and overlap with neighboring pulse, Inter-symbol Interference (ISI) occurs which makes the pulses indistinguishable at the receiver.

## Types of dispersion

There are two types of dispersion

<ul class="ul-in-post">
<li>Inter-modal dispersion (modal dispersion)</li>
<li>Intra-modal dispersion (chromatic dispersion)</li>
</ul>

**Intermodal dispersion** is a type of dispersion due to multimode propagating through an optical fiber. In other words, the propagation delay differences between mode (different light pulses) within a multimode fiber is termed as intermodal or modal dispersion.

**Intramodal dispersion** is also called chromatic dispersion. It is a dispersion that occur due to finite spectral linewidth of the optical sources. As optical light sources like (Laser and LED) emit not just a single frequency but band of frequencies then the propagation delay difference yields an intramodal dispersion.

This propagation delay differences can be caused by the waveguide material and fiber structure which is used for confining the light.
When the dispersion is caused due to the material of the fiber then it is said to be material dispersion. Also if the dispersion is caused by the fiber structure the it is said to be waveguide dispersion.

**Material dispersion**
Is a dispersion or pulse broadening which is as a result of different group velocities of various spectral component of the light launched into the fiber.

**Waveguide dispersion**
It is as a result of variation in group velocity with wavelength for a particular mode.

## summary

Dispersion is the broadening of light pulses which tend to degrade the transmitted signal strength.
Intramodal dispersion occurs in both single and multimode optical fiber whereas intermodal dispersion occurs mostly or only in multimode fibers.
