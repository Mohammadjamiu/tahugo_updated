**Wired and wireless networks** are two types of computer networks that are used for communication and transmission of data between devices.

## What are Wired Networks?

**Wired networks** are networks where devices (such as computers, printers, and routers) are physically connected to each other and to the internet or another network using cables.

The most common type of cable used for wired networks is called an **Ethernet cable**. Another type of cable used in wired networks for data transmission are coaxial cables.

For example, you might have a wired network set up in your home where your desktop computer is connected to your internet modem/router using an Ethernet cable.

This allows your computer to access the internet and communicate with other devices on the network.

**Wired networks** tend to be faster and more reliable than wireless networks because the physical cables provide a stable connection that's less susceptible to interference.

**Examples of wired networks** in use include Ethernet connections between computers in an office, or coaxial cables providing internet access to a home.

## What are Wireless Networks?

**Wireless networks**, unlike wired networks, use radio waves or infrared signals to connect devices without the need for physical cables. The most common wireless technology used for home and office networks is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

**Read On:** [What are radio waves? What are radio waves used for?](/electronics/what-are-radio-waves-and-what-are-they-used-for/)

For example, you might have a wireless network set up in your home where your laptop, smartphone, and tablet are all connected to your Wi-Fi router. This allows all of your devices to access the internet and communicate with each other without the need for cables.

**Wireless networks** are more convenient than wired networks because you can connect to them from anywhere within range of the signal. However, wireless networks tend to be slower and less reliable than wired networks because the signal can be affected by interference from other devices or physical obstacles.

**Examples of wireless networks** in use include Wi-Fi connections between laptops, smartphones, and routers in a home or office, or Bluetooth connections between a smartphone and wireless headphones.

|     | Factor                     | Wired Networks                                                                                                                                                           | Wireless Networks                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.  | **Connectivity**           | Wired networks use physical cables (such as Ethernet cable and coaxial cable) to connect devices together.                                                               | Wireless networks use radio waves (Wi-Fi) or infrared signals (Bluetooth) to connect devices without cables.                                                                                            |
| 2.  | **Security**               | Wired networks are generally considered to be more secure than wireless networks as physical cables are used, which does not allow easy interference of signals.         | Wireless networks are considered to be less secure than wired networks, as the radio wave used for data transmission can be interrupted or interfered.                                                  |
| 3.  | **Speed**                  | Wired networks typically offer faster and more stable speeds than wireless networks, as cables provide a direct and dedicated connection between devices.                | Speed of wireless networks are typically slow and less stable as compared to wire networks.                                                                                                             |
| 4.  | **Mobility / Flexibility** | Wired networks provide less mobility or flexibility than wireless networks, as devices must be connected to cables.                                                      | Wireless networks provide greater mobility and flexibility than wired networks, as devices can connect from anywhere within range of the wireless signal.                                               |
| 5.  | **Cost**                   | Wired networks can be more expensive to set up initially, as they require cables and other physical infrastructure.                                                      | Wireless networks may have lower initial costs, but may require additional equipment such as routers or access points to ensure coverage throughout an area.                                            |
| 6.  | **Setup and maintenance**  | Wired networks generally require more time and effort to set up and maintain, as cables need to be run and devices need to be physically connected to the network.       | Wireless networks are typically easier to set up, but may require more maintenance due to potential signal interference or connectivity issues.                                                         |
| 7.  | **Network range**          | Wired networks have a greater range than wireless networks. Copper cables can carry signals up to 100 m, while fiber optic cables can carry signals over 100 km or more. | Wireless networks have a shorter range than wired networks. Typically, the range of a wireless network is a few hundred feet to several hundred yards or meters, depending on the setup and conditions. |
