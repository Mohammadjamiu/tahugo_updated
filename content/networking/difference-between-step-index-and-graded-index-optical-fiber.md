One of the major difference between a step index fiber and a graded index fiber is that, a **step index fiber** has a core with constant refractive index and make a step change from the core - cladding interface while a **graded index fiber** does not have a core with constant refractive index and it makes a gradual change from the core - cladding interface.

## Difference between step index and graded index fiber

### Step index fiber

1. It has a constant core refractive index.

1. The refractive index profile makes a step change at the core-cladding interface as oppose to gradual change which graded index fiber makes.
1. Step index occur in single mode fiber and multimode fiber hence, they are term single-mode step index fiber and multimode step index fiber respectively.

1. The single mode step index fiber which is also called mono-mode step index fiber has a core diameter in the order of 2 â€“ 10um while the multimode step index fiber has a core diameter greater than 50um(micro meter).
1. Light propagates in step index fiber in a zig-zag form.
1. In single mode step index fiber, there is the presence of low intermodal <a class="links-to-article" href="/networking/what-is-dispersion-in-optical-fiber-and-the-types/">dispersion</a> (i.e. there is less pulse broadening) while in multimode step index fiber, because of many rays of light propagates through the fiber there is the presence of pulse broadening.
1. Because of pulse broadening, multimode has low bandwidth and it can be used in low bandwidth application while single mode has a higher bandwidth than multimode.
1. Also due to the low bandwidth of the multimode step index fiber, it has more <a class="links-to-article" href="/networking/what-are-the-different-causes-of-transmission-impairments/">attenuation</a> that that of the single-mode step index fiber.
1. Step index fiber is often used for short distance communication.

### Graded index fiber

1. It does not have a constant core refractive index.

1. The refractive index profile makes a gradual change at the core-cladding interface as oppose to step change which step index fiber makes
1. Graded index occur in multimode mode fiber only.
1. The light rays that propagates in a graded index fiber is either in a skew or helical form.
1. Graded index fiber has a higher bandwidth.
1. There is less attenuation of light rays.
1. Graded index fiber is often used for long distance communication.
