In order for electromagnetic (radio) waves to travel, a transmitting antenna and a receiving antenna is required. The path or mode in which the radio waves follow or can travel is termed as radio wave propagation.

There are three (3) modes of radio wave propagation is as follows;

<ul class="ul-in-post">
<li> Ground wave or surface wave propagation</li>
<li> Space wave and line of sight (LOS) propagation</li>
<li> Skywave propagation</li>
</ul>

## Ground wave propagation

**Ground wave propagation** is a mode of propagation in which the electromagnetic wave follows the curvature or contour of the earth.

The antennas used for propagation are placed vertically (i.e. the electric (E) component orientation is vertical) and the frequency used for transmission are low frequency or medium frequency (< 2Mhz).

The distance at which the wave can be propagated is dependent on the power of the transmitted signal.
Hence, it is mostly employed for short distance communication or local radio communication e.g. AM radio.

## Space wave or line of sight (LOS) propagation

**In space wave propagation**, normally the mode of propagation is through the line of sight (LOS) mechanism in which antennas (both transmitting and receiving antenna) are directed or point toward each other.

The waves travel in a straight or direct path and the frequency used for such propagation is greater than 30Mhz.

Due to this, the waves are mostly obstructed or limited by tall objects like buildings. This results in shadow zone and diffraction (i.e. bending of the waves around an object).

It is used for TV broadcasting and microwave communication link.

Apart from the LOS mode of propagation, another type of propagation which is an alternative is the tropospheric mode of propagation. It is used as a way to curb the obstacle faced by LOS propagation.
In tropospheric propagation, the troposphere which is a layer that extend up to height of about 10Km to 15km is used as a point for creating a communication link.

At the lower part of the troposphere, a phenomenon termed as temperature inversion occur due to different metrological conditions.

For tropospheric propagation or communication link to be established, two directional antennas must be place in such a way that their beams intersect the temperature inversion region. The point of intersection is termed as common volume.

It is employed in long distance telephone links.

It is an alternative to LOS (microwave) links most especially in difficult terrain.

## Skywave propagation

**Skywave propagation** is a type of propagation that involves the use of the ionosphere for scattering and reflection of electromagnetic waves.

The ionosphere is a region in the atmosphere which extend up to height of 50Km to 400Km which comprise of layers with ionized gases. The ionization of the layers is caused due to solar radiation.

The ionosphere layers are of three types:

<ul class="ul-in-post">
<li>D layer</li>
<li>E layer</li>
<li>F layer</li>
</ul>

During winter (cold) period or day, the 3 layers are present where F layer is splited up into F1 and F2 layer while on a summer (hot) day the F2 layer goes beyond 400Km as it ionization has increased.

However, on the night of summer and winter day, the D layer vanishes by combining with the E layer to become just an E layer and the F1 and F2 layers combined to form F layer.

Skywave propagation is used for long distance radio communication.

## Summary

In summary the path which a radio wave can travel is referred to as radio wave propagation.

Ground wave propagation is used for propagating radio waves with low to medium frequency by following the curvature of the earth surface. Due to their long wavelength is used for short distance communication.

Space wave propagation involves the LOS (line of sight) and tropospheric mode of propagation. They use frequency which is high.

The line of sight (LOS) propagation can be implemented if the antennas are facing each other while if it is impossible to for direct transmission then a tropospheric mode of propagation can be used.

Due to their short wavelength, they can travel far only if there is no interference. The LOS is used in microwave link while tropospheric propagation is used in telephone communication link.

Lastly, the skywave which is termed as ionospheric propagation is used for long distance radio communication as it involves the use of the ionosphere for propagation.
