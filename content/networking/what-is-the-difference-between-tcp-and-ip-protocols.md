When you send data over the Internet, it is broken down into small pieces called packets. These packets are then sent from one device to another until they reach their destination.

**The Internet Protocol (IP)** is responsible for routing these packets from one device to another. It works by assigning each device on the Internet a unique IP address, which is used to identify the device and determine where to send the data.

However, IP alone cannot ensure that the data will be delivered reliably or in the correct order. This is where the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) comes in.

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** provides a reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of packets between devices. It works by establishing a connection between two devices before any data is sent. Once the connection is established, data is transmitted in segments, with each segment being acknowledged by the receiver before the next one is sent.

If a segment is lost or corrupted during transmission, TCP will detect this and request that the sender retransmit the missing or corrupted segment. This ensures that the data is received in the correct order and without errors.

In general, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are two separate protocols that work together to enable communication over the Internet by routing packets between devices and providing reliable and ordered delivery of data.

> In summary, **IP** is responsible for routing data across the network and providing an addressing scheme, while **TCP** is responsible for establishing a reliable connection and managing the flow of data between devices.
