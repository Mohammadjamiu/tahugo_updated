**WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) or DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing)** is an analog technique used in the multiplexing or the combination of several optical (light) signals into one single optical signal which can then be transmitted through a common link or channel.

As it is seen that these techniques are used for the combination of multiple signal into just a single signal. So you might ask what is now the difference between these techniques.

## Difference between WDM and DWDM

In multiplexing, a data link which has enormous bandwidth is multiplexed to create multiple channels so multiple information or signals can be transmitted which yield an efficient use of bandwidth.

> Note.

> **Bandwidth** refers to the capability of a transmission channel or the amount of signal that the channel can accept.
> This is useful because in this modern age, the use of data and telecommunication has significantly increased which results in high traffic.
> So to curb this high traffic issues, the efficient use of bandwidth is important.

1. **Name**

   WDM is wavelength division multiplexing while DWDM is dense wavelength division multiplexing.

2. **Spacing**

   The spacing of channels is more in WDM than DWDM. DWDM makes the channels spacing as low as possible so as to create more useful channel.

3. **Efficient use of bandwidth**

   As the spacing is less in DWDM, the channel bandwidth is utilized for a better transmission of data.

4. **Band selection**

   WDM uses the O (original) and C (conventional) band while DWDM uses the C (conventional) and L (long) band. Low loss occurs in C and L band as compared to O band.
